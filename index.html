    <h3>A Modern Melville</h3>
  <p><img class="inline-pic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/John_Irving.jpeg">Author of 14 novels, 2 memoirs, a short story collection, a children's book, and an Academy Award winning screenplay, John Irving tackles controversial and taboo themes with humor, aplomb, and keen insight into human nature.</p>
    <p>Born in Exeter, New Hampshire in 1942, John Irving studied writing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut</a> at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.  He published his first novel, <em>Setting Free the Bears</em> in 1968, and in the following decade, he taught at Mount Holyoke College and published two more novels.</p>
    <p>His breakout success came in 1978, when he published <em>The World According to Garp</em>, which delves into sexuality, gender roles, and death.  Along with Steve Tesich, Irving adapted the book into a screenplay.  The film starred Robin Williams as the titular Garp, and co-starred Glen Close as his mother and John Lithgow as a transsexual woman who formerly played in the NFL.  Close and Lithgow both received Oscar nominations for thier roles.</p>
    <p>Irving continued to write, and several of his novels were adapted into films, including <em>The Cider House Rules</em>, starring Michael Caine, Tobey McGuire, and Charlize Theron.  The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Irving won for Best Adapted Screenplay.  </p>
    <p>His 14th novel, <em>Avenue of Mysteries</em> was published in 2015.  </p>
